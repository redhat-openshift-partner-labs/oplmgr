<h3>Console URL and Credentials</h3>
<p>Below you will find detailed information on accessing your cluster.</p>
<p>Your OpenShift cluster is accessible at the following URL:
    <br/>{{ .ConsoleURL }}
    <br/>
    <br/>Here are your login credentials:
    <br/>
    <br/>username: kubeadmin
    <br/>password: {{ .KubeAdminLink }}
    <br/>
    <br/>You can also get your kubeconfig here: {{ .KubeConfigLink }}
</p>
<p>The kubeadmin password and kubeconfig links will expire within 24 hours or after being read; whichever happens first.
    <br/>We recommend clicking the Raw Text button if you want to copy and paste your credentials from the links.
</p>
<br/>
<p>NOTE: You must save your work and not rely on your OpenShift cluster to save critical data. You should incorporate
    best practices when it comes to backing up your data, checking code into version control, etc.</p>
